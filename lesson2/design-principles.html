        <h2>Proximity</h2>
        <h3>Discover Puerto Rico</h3>
        <a href="https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/">discoverpuertorico.com</a>
        <picture>
          <img src="Images/PR.jpg" alt="Beach in Puerto Rico" />

        <p>
          In the principle of proximity, we see how the proximity of the object
          being displayed is changes to allow a focused view of what is being
          projected. The Discover Puerto Rico website has done a great job in
          illustrating what a visit to the island might look like.
        </p>
        <p>
          We see the designer chose a picture that is zoomed out enough to cover
          s crystal clear sandy beach, as well as some coral reefs, palm trees
          and lush green forests. The capture to Discover Puerto Rico is
          centered to allow the viewer to discover what it is on this picture
          they would like to do on their next visit to this Caribbean
          destination.

        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <h3>Ford</h3>
        <a
          href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/super-duty/?gnav=header-all-vehicles"
          >Ford.com</a
        >
        <picture>
          <img src="Images/Ford.jpg" alt="Ford Truck Towing a Camper" />
        </picture>
        <p>
          Ford does a great job in showcasing their products. By using contrast,
          Ford here matches the description of the truck model on the website by
          matching the blue color of the truck in the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ford uses the power of contrast to make the truck stand out from the
          picture as they are not interested on selling towable RVs, predict
          stormy weather or showcase a tree line.
        </p>
        <p>
          By adding a contrasting color Ford makes their truck stand out in this
          beautiful picture.
        </p>

        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <h3>Apple</h3>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">Apple.com</a>
        <picture>
          <img src="Images/Apple.jpg" alt="MacBook Laptop from Apple website" />
        </picture>
        <p>
          Who better than Apple to show us a great aligned website to display
          their MacBook product. By keeping everything centered, and making the
          product picture the main object of the page, Apple captures the
          viewersâ€™ attention with a simple yet impressive MacBook picture
          followed by simple wording that captures product description, updates
          and changes as well as who their target market is for this product. By
          keeping everything aligned in this matter, it makes it simple and
          comfortable on the eyes to capture all the intended information
          quickly.
